## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use the resize event listener to change the display values of an element. This was helpful to hide the share container if it was already opened when switching to desktop or mobile view. I also practiced how to manipulate elements using JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [Clip-path](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/) - This helped me create shapes which was used for the share container popup in the desktop view.
